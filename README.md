# Gym TrAIner

Gym TrAIner is a neural network designed to act as your gym trainer. Currently, it only watches you doing your exercises and counts reps for you. For now, it only supports squats.

A huge thanks to [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasrenotte) and his [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDUihpj6ro) which is the inspiration of this project.

Possible extensions to this project:

- [ ] Add more exercises (pushups, situps, etc.)
- [ ] Log number of sets and reps with date, time and exercise
- [ ] Use the logged data to suggest the number of reps and sets(progressive overloading)
- [ ] Add a voice to the software such that it will shout motivational phrases like "Come on! You can do it!" if the user is taking a while to perform another rep
